          If you are one of the many impacted by the coronavirus pandemic you
          might need some temporary relief. The COVID-19 payment assistance
          program will allow you to defer your required mortgage payment for up
          to three billing cycles.* There are several things you need to
          consider when taking advantage of the COVID-19 Payment Assisstance
          Program so please educate yourself and assess your situation before
          requesting forbearance.

                You need to know who owns your mortgage before you can determine
                if you’re eligible for mortgage relief. The place you send or
                make your payments might be different than they the company that
                owns your loan.

                Many mortgages are owned by government-sponsored entities Fannie
                Mae and Freddie Mac. To find out if your mortgage is owned by
                one of these, simply go to Fannie Mae’s or Freddie Mac’s lookup
                pages and enter your name, address and last four digits of your
                Social Security number.
              </p>

              <p>
                If you don’t find your mortgage there, you’ll need to contact
                your mortgage servicer which is the company you make your
                payments. Usually you can refer to your monthly mortgage
                statement and call the number listed on the statement.
              </p>
              <br /><br />
              <p>
                If you can’t figure out who owns your loan then you can send a
                written request to the loan servicer usually the company you pay
                each month. The servicer is legally obligated to tell you the
                name, address and telephone number of the loan’s actual owner.
                The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau offers a sample letter
                you can send.

                Even though only 70% of all mortgages are federally backed and
                eligible for assistance many lenders are voluntarily aligning
                the relief they are providing with the relief provided for the
                federally backed mortgages.

                Homeowners are provided with a foreclosure moratorium of at
                least 60 days starting on March 18, 2020. This includes the
                initiation of new foreclosures as well as the continuation of
                foreclosures that had already been initiated; this does not
                include vacant or abandoned properties. They are also provided
                with the right to request and receive forbearance on their
                mortgage payments for up to 6 months, with the option to extend
                for an additional 6 months (total max of 1 year), as well as the
                option to discontinue the forbearance at any time. During the
                forbearance period, servicers are prohibited from charging fees
                or interest beyond what the borrower would have had to pay if
                they were making their payments as scheduled.

                No. A mortgage forebearance is NOT a forgiveness of debt. Anyone
                who requests and receives a mortgage forbearance from their
                lender will have to work out a loan modification or repayment
                plan with the servicer at the end of the forebearance period to
                resume making payments including missed payments.

                If you are approved for a forbearance, a payment delay, or other
                payment arrangement with your creditor or servicer, and you are
                current on your accounts, then the creditor or servicer will
                continue to report you to the credit rating agencies (or CRAs)
                as current or up-to-date. In this case, your credit report and
                score would not be negatively impacted by these non- or delayed
                payments during the covered period of the arrangement.
                Unfortunately, if you were already reported to be behind on
                payments prior to the payment arrangement, the creditor or
                servicer can continue to report you as late to the CRAs, meaning
                continued non-payments may be treated negatively on your credit
                report and score.

                Federal student loan payments, which are suspended through
                September 2020, are treated on credit reports as if the payments
                are made. Therefore, if you are unable to make payments on your
                federal student loan, non-payments through September 2020 will
                not negatively impact your credit report and score.
