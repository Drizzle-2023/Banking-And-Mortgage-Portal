                <p>If you are one of the many impacted by the coronavirus pandemic you might need some
                    temporary relief. The COVID-19 payment assistance program will allow you to defer
                    your required mortgage payment for up to three billing cycles.* There are several 
                    things you need to consider when taking advantage of the COVID-19 Payment Assisstance 
                    Program so please educate yourself and assess your situation before requesting forbearance.
